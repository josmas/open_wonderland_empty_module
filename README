-- The empty module --
----------------------

This is an empty module that can be used to bootstrap Open Wonderland module development.

----------------------------------------------
Classpaths and expected structure for Netbeans
----------------------------------------------

This module will need little modifications if it is downloaded (or cloned) in a structure 
that resembles the following 'my-own-wonderland-modules' directory.  Please note that for 
module development, the sources of Open Wonderland have to be available locally.

If you have your Wonderland sources in your user directory, the expected structure should
look like:

~/wonderland
	| [loads of stuff here]

~/wonderland-modules
	|
	--> stable
	|	| [modules here]
	|
	--> unstable
		| [modules here]

~/my-own-wonderland-modules
	|
	--> unstable
		|
		--> empty_module

If you drop the empty_module in that directory (or similar but with your own names), then 
all the classpaths should be ready to go. If not, follow the instructions in the tutorial
to change your settings for Netbeans.

Cleaning up git references after cloning
-----------------------------------------
If you have cloned this project, you will want to clean up the remote references to the original git project.
To do so just delete the .git folder. You can also delete the .gitigore file if you are not going to be using git,
and the file at src/classes/.only_here_for_git_delete_me which is only there cause git does not keep track of empty
folders.

After cleaning these files up, you can initialise your own git repo if you want to do so (git init).
