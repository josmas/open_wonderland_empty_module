----------------------
-- The empty module --
----------------------

This is an empty module that can be used to bootstrap Open Wonderland module development.

----------------------------------------------
Classpaths and expected structure for Netbeans
----------------------------------------------

This module will need little modifications if it is downloaded (or cloned) in a structure 
that resembles the following 'my-own-wonderland-modules' directory.  Please note that for 
module development, the sources of Open Wonderland have to be available locally.

If you have your Wonderland sources in your user directory, the expected structure should
look like:

~/wonderland
	| [loads of stuff here]

~/wonderland-modules
	|
	--> stable
	|	| [modules here]
	|
	--> unstable
		| [modules here]

~/my-own-wonderland-modules
	|
	--> unstable
		|
		--> empty_module

If you drop the empty_module in that directory (or similar but with your own names), then 
all the classpaths should be ready to go. If not, follow the instructions in the tutorial
to change your settings for Netbeans.
